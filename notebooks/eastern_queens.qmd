Progressives suffered two close loses in Eastern Queens that would have added to both their geographic and demographic diversity. In the 23rd DSA endorsed Jaslin Kaur narrowly lost to Jane Dough, and in the 32nd Felicia Singh won her primary but lost a close race to Republican Joann Arioloa in the general. Both women refer to themselves as socialists, both ran on progressive platforms, and both had over $100,000 of independent expenditure money, drawn primarily from real estate interests, used against them. In the 23rd Kaur won the South Asian vote but lost the East Asian vote. In the 32nd Singh won the ethnically diverse north half of her district but lost the white southern half.
