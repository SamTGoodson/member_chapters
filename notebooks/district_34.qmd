District 34 lies to the West of District 37, representing the large section of Bushwick not represented by Sandy Nurse as well as some sections of Ridgewood. In our interview Michael Lange described this district as the one most primed for a DSA candidate that didn't already have one, and indeed the progressive (but non DSA) Guttierez won in a landslide, securing 79% of the vote with no opponent securing more than 10%. Because the margin of victory was so large, Gutierez's win doesn't lend itself to detailed analysis.
