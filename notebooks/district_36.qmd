The contest in the 36th Council district was won by 23 year old upstart progressive Chi Osse. Radicalized by the Black Lives Matter movement, Osse ran a grassroots campaign without the backing of the major institutional players of either the establishment or the upstart left. He narrowly defeated Henry Butler, an establishment Democrat with longstanding ties to the County party. This election was important for several reasons. 1) it is the clearest example of the stereotypical progressive coalition examined in this dissertation; Osse clearly won in the gentrified Western portion of the district with highly-educated white professionals as the core of his electoral coalition 2) Osse won a truly outsider campaign, running against the county party without the support of the DSA and managing only a split WFP endorsement 3) the district has seen several high-profile DSA elections before and after, the frequency of elections and the dynamic laid out above make for an interesting contest.

## The District

The 36th is coterminous with Bedford-Sutyvesent, a longtime center of Black culture and political power. The district has also in recent decades become synonymous with gentrification as younger White professionals move into the district, primarily in the strip of the district to the west of Nostrand Avenue. The district is in the top quintile of Black residents city wide, and in the second of West Indian residents, as well as in the second of Whites born outside of New York State. It sits in the fourth quintile of income but in the second of education. Figure 1 maps the white transplant population.

## The Candidates

Three candidates had a viable shot at winning the district, Chi Osse, Henry Butler, and Tahirah Moore. Others ran but and participated in debates but did not fundraise or receive enough votes to merit discussion. Osse is a very young (23 at the time of election) self-described socialist and third generation Brooklynite. Osse had at one time been a member of the DSA but left the party, citing differences in ideology. His progressivism centered around Black Lives Matter and defending the police. This was Osse’s primary talking point both on the campaign trail and on social media in the months leading up to the primary. 3% of the 780 tweets he sent in the first half of 2021 had something to do with policing, double the median amount for all candidates. Also of chief concern to Osse was housing affordability, a problem which he attributed in large part to the relationship between developers and politicians, including his opponents. Like Michael Hollingsworth in the 35th, Osse argued the only solution to help working people in the district would come from an outsider, someone not tainted by what he saw as the corrupt politics of the past.

Osse's primary opponent was Henry L. Butler. Butler was twice Osse's age, a fact he did not shy away from emphasizing. He had grown up in the Tompkins Houses, a large public housing development in Northern Bed-Stuy that neighbors the more famous Marcy Houses. This also separates him demographically from Osse, whose father was a successful music producer and grew up in a higher economic class. Butler had years of experience in Booklyn politics, having served on Community Board 8 and as a district manager for the county party. He also frequently discussed housing affordability and police excess, but from a different angle than Osse, focusing instead on productive relationships with officers and developers.

Tahirah Moore also ran a viable campaign, though she remained in a distant third in terms of both fundraising and votes. She secured a split Working Families Party endorsement with Osse. Moore is also a native of the districts, having group up in the Marcy Homes, and prior to running for the council seat worked for the outgoing council member. Moore's ideological stances were more difficult to pin down than the other two candidates, her campaign focuses more on personal appeal and legislative experience.

The differences between Osse and Butler were clearly articulated at a debate co-hosted by Politics NY and Scheps Media. The hour long debate featured frequent tense exchanges between Osse and Butler on age, experience, policing, and housing. The exchange was well summarized by Butler's closing remark “I didn’t wake up one day and do some Black Lives Matter marching and decide I should run for city council.” Butler consistently touted his experience and Osse’s youth and Osse in return pinged Butler again and again on his connections to private developers and donations he had taken from the PBA in a previous election cycle. Moore largely stayed out of the hostilities, except for to correct a misstatement of her position in the outgoing CM's office. 

The most contentious issue in the debate was housing. Both Butler and Osse picked affordable housing as the most important issue the district was facing, but approached solving the problem differently. Osse insisted gentrification was green, Butler retorted that it was White and Green, “just go look and Vaughn King Park” he offered as evidence. Osse, like other progressives, felt the housing crisis was exacerbated by private developers building housing that did not incorporate enough affordable housing, or termed affordable housing stock that was really not. Butler listed several housing projects that he approved on Community Board 3 that were constructed by minority or woman-owned developers (MWBE) and contained what he emphatically claimed were truly affordable housing. Osse used air quotes when Butler used the term affordable. Osse and Butler clearly disagree about the definition of the term affordable, but the projects Butler mentioned do indeed feature a significant volume of units for residents at as low as 30% of AMI with rents well below the neighborhood market rate. Osse proudly mentioned his work in opposition to development at 920 Park Place that would have demolished a section of the abandoned historical landmark currently siting on the property. He also pitched an amorphous "re-imagining" of the land use process.

The same dynamic characterized their discussion of policing. Osse criticized Butler for having accepted \$5,000 in donations from the PBA in a previous campaign, referencing his own history of being stopped and frisked while doing so. Butler retorted that he would "not be lectured by a young man when I myself was stopped and frisked, growing up in Tompkins houses, thrown up against the wall coming out of my own building.” Butler insisted that the only way to improve community police relations was to sit down with officers and discuss. He emphasized this theme more broadly; the only way to get anything done in politics was to discuss it with people he disagreed with. He mentioned his youth in Bed-Stuy of the 1980s and ‘90s, as well as the gun violence crisis affecting the district today, and insisted that the police were needed.

The tension between these two candidates perfectly distills disagreements in NYC politics broadly and especially the tension of progressivism in Central Brooklyn. Osse ran as a proud outsider looking to unseat a corrupt party establishment, representing the signature issues of progressives in the cycle: defunding to abolish and ending the housing crisis through government intervention rather than through market processes. Butler was a veteran of local politics who came up through the county party and represented a more traditionally moderate liberal agenda. As the next section will make clear, these messages appealed to two very different blocs of voters.

## The Election

Voters clearly saw the difference in Osse and Butler. Table 1 shows the flow of votes from he first RCV round to the second. Osse and Butler alone at the top of the ballot are two of the three most common choices. Voters who ranked one of the two first did not frequently rank the other second, this option is not in the top ten most common options (less than 2,000 combined voters chose to do this). 


```{python}
c_tbl = d36.groupby('district_36_choice_1')['district_36_choice_2'].value_counts(dropna=False).reset_index(name='count').sort_values('count', ascending=False).head(10)
cols = ['Choice 1','Choice 2','Count']
Markdown(tabulate(c_tbl,headers = cols,showindex=False))
```

Figure 2 shows the distribution of votes for the top three candidates. Osse clearly wins the Western strip of the district, with strength especially along the northwestern corner of the district that the G train hooks through and along the A/C corridor in the South. Butler and Moore's strength is in the Northern strip of the district where the Marcy and Tompkins houses are located as well as the Southeastern corner of the district which is less white than the rest of the district. Figure 3 below the map shows a correlation table for Osse's first-round vote share. The strongest correlations with Osse's vote share is the white transplant population, the share with a college degree, and the shares of journalists, designers, and software engineers. The strongest negative correlation is with the share of janitors, home health aids, and government workers (especially with publically employed social workers). The map and corelation table suggest Osse won a population of white, well-educated, professionals, particularly those born outside of New York state.

As table 2 demonstrates, many of these variables are themselves highly correlated, which makes building a regression model to predict vote share difficult. To make this modeling possible factor analysis was employed. This process reduces these many overlapping and related variables to a smaller set of factors, in this case four. The number of factors is set by analysing how much of the variance in the data can be explained by adding and additional factor. If the data is well suited for factor analysis, the factors clearly demonstrate a set of the data that can be analysed by looking at how strongly each variable loads on each factor. Below are two tables, the first is a heatmap of each independant variable as it loads on each factor. The second is a regression table showing each factor regressed on Chi Osse's vote share. 

Factor 1 is characterized by strong positive loadings on Hispanic share, home health aides, female-headed households, bus commuting, and janitorial staff, alongside strong negative loadings on education, non-Hispanic Black share, homeowners, and income. In effect, it captures neighborhoods that are lower-income, renter-heavy, predominantly Latino, and oriented toward care- and service-sector work with high dependence on the bus sytem. In the OLS, Factor 1 has a large, highly significant negative coefficient (–6.49, p<0.001), indicating that districts scoring high on this working-class, racially diverse profile saw substantially lower vote shares for Osse.

Factor 2 is the the gentrification factor. It loads very positively on education, non-Hispanic white share, white transplant ratio, managers, journalists and designers, software engineers, and work-from-home rate, while loading negatively on female-headed households, bus commuting, and Black homeownership. This clearly delineates gentrified districts with well-educated, predominantly white, high-income professional newcomers. In the regression, Factor 2 exerts a large positive effect (7.26, p<0.001), showing that these progressive professional neighborhoods delivered significantly higher vote shares for Osse.

Factor 3 exhibits positive loadings on work-from-home rate, living alone ratio, sanitation workers, and train commuting, with negative loadings on homeowners, Black homeownership, and drive commuting. It appears to index a blend of more transient, train-and-remote-work-oriented districts that nonetheless retain a strong renter component. However, its OLS coefficient (0.81) is small and statistically insignificant (p=0.36), indicating that this mixed mobility-and-tenure profile had no reliable association with Osse's vote share.

Factor 4 loads positively on home health aides, sanitation workers, female-headed households, and bus commuting, and negatively on education, software workers, lawyers, and work-from-home rate. It thus captures older, service-sector neighborhoods with less professional employment and lower educational attainment, but with strong care-and-municipal-service presence. In the regression, Factor 4 carries a significant negative coefficient (–4.02, p<0.001), meaning these traditional service-worker enclaves were associated with lower electoral support for Osse.

These factors are attempting to measure and explain variation, which is why no factor is strongly associated with non-Hispanic Black share. Because, even while rapidly changing, Bed-Stuy is still predominantly Black, this variables is not fluctuating enough to be meaninffully captured. In the correlation table above Osse vote is similarly not strongly correlated with nhb population, possibly also because the population is not fluctuating enough to note correlation. If the factoring and regression above is repeated pulling nhb out of the facoring process and adding it in as its own IV, it is not statistically siginificant nore does it large. Non-Hispanic black population is not a strong predictor of Chi Osse's vote. 

White population, however, is a strong predictor of Osse vote. It is strongly correlated with it and Factor 2, the white and white newcomer factor, is a strong and significant predictor of Osse's vote, as is education and the white-collar educated professions. Osse's electoral constituency here is clearly well-educated white professional newcomers and it clearly does not include working-class sections of the district.
