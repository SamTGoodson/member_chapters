Julie Won won the primary in Queen's 26th Council district in a tight race against Amit Bagga. Won also won the rank-and-file Working Families Party vote for their endorsement, but the branch's vote was overridden by the central body and the endorsement instead given to Bagga. For Won this was clear insider baseball, Bagga had refused to rebuke De Blasio for the policing of the George Floyd protests and now his reward had come home. Thus the contest pitted the grassroots against the progressive establishment.

## The District

The 26th sits immediately to the South of Tiffany Caban's district, occupying most of Long Island City and portions of Sunnyside and Astoria. It is in the second highest quintile of education, income, and the white transplant ratio, and in the highest quintile of standard deviation for those categories, signaling significant spread.
